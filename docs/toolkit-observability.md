# Toolkit Observability

Buildchain ships a small logging toolkit for repository workflows and project
scripts. The goal is to separate time spent in Buildchain's framework from time
spent in the consumer's own build, test, packaging, and publish steps.

## CLI Logging

```bash
buildchain mark \
  --event native.configure \
  --phase configure \
  --component cmake \
  --attribute preset=release

buildchain span \
  --event native.build \
  --phase build \
  --component cmake \
  -- cmake --build build --config Release

buildchain log summary --json
buildchain verify observability-log .buildchain/logs/events.jsonl --min-events 4
```

Every event records a timestamp. `span` records duration and preserves the
wrapped command's exit code.

## Library API

```js
import { createBuildchainLogger } from "@kungfu-tech/buildchain/logging";

const logger = createBuildchainLogger({
  source: "consumer",
  component: "native-build",
  phase: "compile",
});

const span = logger.span("native.compile", { attributes: { target: "release" } });
try {
  await compile();
  span.end();
} catch (error) {
  span.error(error);
  throw error;
}
```

Use the API when a build script has internal stages that are invisible to the
outer workflow. Keep secret values out of attributes; known sensitive keys are
redacted, but callers should still avoid logging private material.

## Release Gate

Buildchain's own binary distribution lane verifies required log events before
uploading release assets. Consumers can apply the same pattern:

```bash
buildchain verify observability-log .buildchain/logs/events.jsonl \
  --require-phase build \
  --require-phase package \
  --require-component workflow \
  --require-event native.build.start \
  --require-event native.build.end
```

This makes missing instrumentation a release failure instead of a dashboard
afterthought.
